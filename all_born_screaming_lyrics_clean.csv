Hell Is Near,"Empty cup and a can full of marigolds Half-burned candle, a picture pinned on the wall Letters, records, and ash on linoleum Signs of life, the beginning, the beginning Our beginning, begin again I was bare And your word was still warm in my hand I was bare Wanted all under Heaven allowed Snubbed-out smoke in a pack from the Nowhere Inn Water glass with the smudge of a lipstick stain Box of nails, olive branch, and the Holy Ghost Leave the rest, but come back for the marigolds To begin to be, to begin to bе, to begin to be still ahead I was barе And your word was still warm in my hand I was bare Wanted all under Heaven allowed Give it all away, you give it all away 'Cause the whole world's watching you Give it all away, you give it all away 'Cause the whole world's watching you Give it all away, you give it all away 'Cause the whole world's watching you Give it all away, you give it all away 'Cause the whole world's watching you"

Violent Times,"Violent times Almost lost you in these violent times I forgot people could be so kind In these violent times Dollar signs Almost lost it chasing dollar signs Know the cost but I forgot the price Of buying my lie I must have been dreaming I fell down the well Waking up Waking up in hell Different eyes You're the same, but I got different eyes How could I ever have been so blind?

The Power’s Out,"Monday morning, subway station Pushers pushing, racers racing Came the message on the station ""The power's out across the nation"" And, ""Ladies and gentlemen, it seems we got a problem"" The man on my screen said, just as somebody shot him And the mothers gasped, the children cried Almost could not believe my eyes The power's out And no one can save us No one can blame us now That the power's out It was pouring like a movie Every stranger looked likе they knew me Handsomе cowboys praying, Gothic Said, ""I just remembered being happy"" And ""Ladies and gentlemen, do remember me smiling"" The queer on the train said as she jumped off the platform And some blind folks held the police, crying I swear to you I would not lie The power's out And no one can save us No one can blame us now 'Cause the power's out And no one can save us No one can blame us now 'Cause the power's out That's why I never came home"

So Many Planets,"Misfiring chemicals and scary ideas This revolution isn't fun, ma I'm out of fashion, I got God on my heels I'm dropping promises like H-bombs But keep calm I'm at the back of my head Watching my life happening Watching the sink filling red And I'm not stopping it I have to visit so many planets Before I find my own I fall asleep in the golden highway Before I finally find it Hemorrhaging heartthrob with a six-pack of beer Leaning outside her burned-out window She isn't smiling, but she's happy you're here We'll make a killing from her trauma Oh, mama Here at the back of my head Watching my life happening Feeling distinct smithereens I've gotten usеd to it I have to visit so many planets Beforе I find my own I fall asleep in the golden highway Before I finally find Finally find it La-la-la-la La-la-la-la La-la-la-la La-la La La La"
All Born Screaming,"I have climbed power lines and mountains Just to feel above the ground I have crawled out your hallowed houses Just to feel my headache pound I feel like graffiti on a urinal in the abattoir Well, it goes and it goes I can't stop my legs, I can't feel my feet I own nothing and nothing owns me We're all born screaming We're all born screaming Aye-ah, aye-ah, aye-ah I have climbed into open arms They turned into a straitjacket Stolen hearts I didn't need, but Man, I always paid for them I was a pantomime of a modern girl Those were thе days and I was miserable A karaoke vеrsion of Leonard's ""Hallelujah"" My whole damn life, I had never exhaled Well We're all born screaming We're all born screaming We're all born screaming We're all born screaming Aye, well, aye Well, well, well Oh-oh All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming All born screaming"
